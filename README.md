# AppleS_Artifact
AppleS aims to improve database scalability by delivering the right amount and pattern of user parallel I/O requests to the database system under excessive user parallelism, aligning with the concurrency supported by the database and its underlying I/O stack. In doing so, AppleS improves user-level I/O performance in terms of user-level I/O fairness, throughput and latency stability. Implemented as a user-space module based on system call interception, AppleS is compatible with and portable to different types/versions of databases, different versions of OS kernels and their resource management tools, e.g., Cgroups.
